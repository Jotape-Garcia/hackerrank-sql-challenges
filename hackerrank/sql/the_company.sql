    Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number 
    of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of 
    employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

    Note:

    - The tables may contain duplicate records.
    - The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, if the company_codes 
      are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.
