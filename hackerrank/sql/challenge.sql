    Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, 
    name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total 
    number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of 
    challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number 
    of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude 
    those students from the result.
